### The Initial Release

WARNING: THIS BLASTER IS UNTESTED. THERE MAY BE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE DESIGN. PRINT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

The Thresher is a bullpup pump action springer with a caliburn air volume. This project started as a modification to the lynx... I am in love with my Worker Harrier and I wanted to put a linear bearing on the Lynx to match that smooooooooooth pull on the Harrier. One thing led to another and I ended up designing a pump around a linear rail instead. It then evolved into designing an entire blaster around the new pump… and here we are! It uses a 200mm low profile linear rail (just something I had laying around but they are rather cheap on amazon).

Sort of following the nautical theme I started with my previous blaster design, this one is named after the thresher shark which is known for its rather long caudal fin i.e. the bullpup magazine hanging off the back of the blaster. Yes, the mag is hanging off the bottom and the thresher shark has a long top fin but I felt like the name fit pretty well so...

### Design Overview

The core of this blaster is designed around a 200mm linear rail. This rail theoretically should alleviate any torsional force while pulling back the pump. I wanted this smooth actuation whale also adding to the overall structural rigidity of the blaster which is why I ended up deciding to use the linear rail rather than a rod or bearings straight on aluminum bars. Now, this does add some significant cost to the overall design. The cheap rail I bought was still $15… In the future I may modify the design to use simple aluminum bars and forgo the linear rail but that is unplanned future work at the current moment.

There are 2 main structural bars that give most of the nose to butt support for the blaster. The first runs through the left side and the second runs through the top picatinny rail. They are currently rather long (26in and 22in…). If the length becomes an issue in the future I will probably cut them down and stack them much like the Caliburn v4. The blaster uses the same slotted bar design that the lynx has for converting the long pump action to a short dart reload but instead of running through the top it runs along the right side.

Currently this blaster uses 11in springs and a caliburn sized polycarbonate air tube. The base design compresses the 11in spring to 5.1in but this can easily be modified by changing the location of the keyway on the Plunger Shaft.
